# Grape Leaf Esca Disease Dataset

This dataset is a collection of grape leaf images organized into different directories for training and testing machine learning models to detect the esca disease in grape leaves. The dataset was originally sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rm1000/grape-disease-dataset-original) and rearranged into the following structure:

```
|---grapeleaf_images
|-----|-- ground_truth
|-----|-- test
|-----|-----|----- esca
|-----|-----|----- good
|-----|-- train
|-----|-----|----- good
```

## Dataset Structure

- `grapeleaf_images/`: The root directory containing all the image data.
  - `ground_truth/`: This directory contains the masks generated by running the `esca_masks.py` script on the `test/esca` images. These masks highlight the esca leaf symptoms.
  - `test/`: This directory contains two subdirectories:
    - `esca/`: Images of grape leaves with esca disease symptoms.
    - `non_esca/`: Images of grape leaves that are either healthy or have diseases other than esca.
  - `train/`: This directory contains one subdirectory:
    - `non_esca/`: Images of grape leaves that are either healthy or have diseases other than esca. These images are intended for training machine learning models.

## Dataset Purpose

The goal of this dataset is to train Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to identify esca leaf symptoms from other common grape leaf diseases. This is particularly important when treating esca as a local newly emerging or unidentified disease, where it would be marked as an anomaly if scanned by a vineyard worker.

This dataset will be used to train a custom AnomalyGPT (https://anomalygpt.github.io/) model, which is a specialized model for detecting anomalies in data.

## Usage

To use this dataset, you can load the images from the respective directories (`test/esca`, `test/non_esca`, `train/non_esca`) and preprocess them as needed for your machine learning pipeline. The `ground_truth/` directory contains the masks generated by the `esca_masks.py` script, which can be used for training and evaluation purposes.

Please note that the images in this dataset may be subject to copyright restrictions, and you should ensure that you have the necessary permissions to use them for your intended purpose.
