# Grape Leaf Esca Dataset Preprocessing

This dataset is a collection of grape leaf images organized into different directories for training and testing machine learning models to detect the esca disease in grape leaves. The dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rm1000/grape-disease-dataset-original) and rearranged into the following structure:

## Dataset Purpose

The goal of this repo is to create files for training Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to identify esca leaf symptoms from other common grape leaf diseases. This dataset will be used to train a custom AnomalyGPT model, [grapeleafGPT](https://github.com/mikejrodd/grapeleafGPT), as well as a [binary image classifier](https://github.com/mikejrodd/esca_image_classifier) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with TensorFlow and Keras.

## Dataset Structure

```
|---grapeleaf_images
|-----|-- ground_truth
|-----|-- test
|-----|-----|----- esca
|-----|-----|----- good
|-----|-- train
|-----|-----|----- good
```

- `grapeleaf_images/`: The root directory containing all the image data.
  - `ground_truth/`: This directory contains the masks generated by running the `esca_masks.py` script on the `test/esca` images. These masks highlight the esca leaf symptoms.
  - `test/`: This directory contains two subdirectories:
    - `esca/`: Images of grape leaves with esca disease symptoms.
    - `non_esca/`: Images of grape leaves that are either healthy or have diseases other than esca.
  - `train/`: This directory contains one subdirectory:
    - `non_esca/`: Images of grape leaves that are either healthy or have diseases other than esca. These images are intended for training machine learning models.

## Usage

To use this dataset, you can load the images from Kaggle and preprocess them as needed for your machine learning pipeline. Basic masks are generated by the `esca_masks.py` script, which can be used for training and evaluation purposes.
